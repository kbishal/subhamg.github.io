title: IITK New York Office Internship Day 5 - End up with Mozilla Developer network 
---
##### *May 19, 2016*

I end up with the mozilla developer network documentation on HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. I contacted to my mentor to know what should I start next. But it took so much time due to online conversation. Adarsh was saying me to start reading on angular 2. He want me to watch some [videos](www.egghead.io) on Fundamentat of Angular 2. Shriansh and proneet wants to me design the UI of the clipper. So, I was confused what should I do first. I have no idea what clipper is. Therefore, I started watch the videos on angular 2.

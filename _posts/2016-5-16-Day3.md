##### *May 17, 2016*

Today, I finished the documentation on CSS. Shivanshu said me to read the basics of html/css/javascript from Mozilla developer network. There is a getting started tab and if I do that then it will not take much time to complete. But as I am reading everything about html and css. It is taking so much of my time. So, I was confused that I have to read only the getting started part or all the articles of Mozilla Developer Network on HTML/CSS. To clear my confusion I contacted to my mentor proneet. He said just learn the basics to get you started. You'll definitely learn more as you keep exploring. It's not necessary to know everything at the start itself. 

As my confusion is clear. I started reading documentation on Javascript.

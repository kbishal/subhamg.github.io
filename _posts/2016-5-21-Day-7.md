title: IITK New York Office Internship Day 7 - AngularJS 
---
##### *May 21, 2016*

I started with course on AngularJS 1.x on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs). Completed all the units provided on this course. I learnt how to easilt build single web-page web applications using this popular JavaScript framework.
I also learnt how to use the following to buid a web application:

* [Directives](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-angularjs/lessons/directives/exercises/directives-directives-i?action=lesson_resume) to make standalone UI components.
* [Services](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs) to make communicate with a server.
* [Routing](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs) to build powerful single-page applications.

But as codecademy doesn't provide all the information about angularjs. Therefore, I am heading towards w3school tutorials on [angularJS](http://www.w3schools.com/).

Today I continue with [Advanced text formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting) and completed the HTML basics documentation. I also started to read the basics of CSS. I read the following articles:  
* [How CSS works?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works)
* [CSS Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Syntax)
* [Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors)
* [CSS Value and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Values_and_units)
* [Cascade and inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance)
* [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model)
* [CSS Debugging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Debugging_CSS)

After I completed with assesments on the above articles I had gone through the  [Styling text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS/Styling_text) - one of the most common things to do with CSS. Here I look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, and italics, line and letter spacing, and drop shadows and other text features.

##### *May 21, 2016*

Started with the tutorial on AngularJS at W3school. I read the following topics :

1. [AngularJS Expressions](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_expressions.asp) 
   * They can be written inside double braces: **{{ expression }}**.
   * They can also be written inside a directive: ```ng-bind="expression"```.
   * They can contain literals, operators, and variables. Example - **{{ 5 + 5 }}**
2. [AngularJS Modules](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_modules.asp)
   * The module is a container for the different parts of an application.
   * The module is a container for the application controllers.
   * We write module as : 
     ```var app = angular.module("myApp", []);```
3. [AngularJS Directives](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_directives.asp) are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ```ng-```. Example: ```ng-app``` directive initializes an AngularJS application.
4. [AngularJS ng-model Directive](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_model.asp) binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
5. [AngularJS Data Binding](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_databinding.asp) is the synchronization between the model and the view.
6. [AngularJS Controllers](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_controllers.asp) control the data of AngularJS application.
7. [AngularJS Scope](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_scopes.asp) is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller). It is also available for both the view and the controller.
8. [AngularJS Filters](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_filters.asp) to transform data. They can be added to expressions by using the pipe character ```|```, followed by a filter.
9. [AngularJS Services](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_services.asp)

##### *May 20, 2016*

Shriansh show me the gmantra clipper and Evernote Clipper. I intsalled evernote clipper extension on chrome. Got familiar with 
it. I saw how clipper works. Evernote Clipper chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc?hl=en) allow us to clip web pages as you browse. Keep them all in Evernote. Gmantra clipper work Something similar to evernote clipper. Shriansh told me that I have design the UI of Gmantra clipper. But before that he told me to start reading on AngularJS 1.
